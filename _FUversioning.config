  * Updated the Pirate Submarine microdungeon. It will now spawn less embedded in islands
  * updated shared cyan text (usage: nonstacking modifiers) for users of physicalblock status effect. added this shared text to the spacepunk backpack, since it uses this status effect (saying it only grants 5% phys resistance is thus inaccurate). reduced the size of the original text somewhat to ensure this text fits.

  * added 'blast fist' finisher to Telebrium fists

  Fist Rework:
  * fist weapons now support hold-to-attack, using 3% energy per swing. These strikes reset combo count.
  * fist weapon combos require a bit more finesse, requiring a bit of a delay between strikes or they will default to the above case. combos still require you to attack within a certain time to progress.

  -- Bugs --
  * The Precursor converter no longer processes items in its first output slot.
  * Frames should only be consumed if drones and queens are both present in the hive.
  * Crew bonus diminishing returns adjusted. This should result in proper incremental increases for bonuses that currently do not operate according to expectations.

  * fixed unifiedgravmod code fail. It should now work properly.

  -------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.26^reset;

  -- Assets --
  * reworked the ITD UI to be a lot less cramped and confusing.

  * Mechs lacking environmental protection will now lose health in addition to energy. Both will decrement over time. (you can still move, and function, but one hit will kill you)

  * added generic 'hold down key to use tech' status effect
  * revised x'i tech's tooltip to be clearer, and added the above as an indicator for when it's active.
  * revised crew contract tooltips for crew to indicate that ship mass does not stack with similar values. corrected janitor,mechanic, mechanic 2 not applying ship mass reductions due to improperly configured crew parameter.
  * extractor_xeno_common now supports the inputSlot parameter on the object using it, in the same way centrifuges do.

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
