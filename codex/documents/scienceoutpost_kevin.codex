"^red;The following details infractions allegedly commited against other members of the outpost by one Myulthor 'Kevin' Sanchatak^white; : ",
"Jun 1 - This individual broke into my private office, stole all of my grapes, and rather than eat them constructed an elaborate 'art piece' of me. Peeing on a beehive. He then filled the room with bees, so that when I opened the door I got swarmed and stung 755 times.",
"Jun 2 - Against all better judgement I allowed Kevin to borrow my bunsen burner. When asked to return it, he brought back a small stack of ash and announced that you can burn a bunsen burner with another bunsen burner if you allow it to burn long enough.",
"Jun 3 - My lab notes went missing. Weeks of work. When asking around, several others saw Kevin take them from my desk. I found them later, folded up and being used to prop up a wobbly table.",
"Jun 12 - Kevin got back from vacation today. Is it a coincidence that my lunch was swapped with a bucket of mooshi urine on the same day?",
"Jun 13 - Kevin is forbidden from using the coffee machine, it took me 2 hours to clean the mess it made. I don't care where he got all that blood, it's just unsanitary and I won't stand for it.",
"Jun 14 - A reminder that the Coffee Machine in the kitchen is to be used EXCLUSIVELY for brewing coffee. Any other substance should not be used under any circumstances, so please do not put any of these in the machine: Fruit (of any kind), Vegetables (of any kind), Meat, Florans,  Pixels, Aether, Mercury, Blood.",
"Jun 15 - All of the toilet paper rolls appear to have been replaced with sandpaper. All of them. Even the backups. I can hear Kevin giggling.",
"Jun 19 - Why the hell is all of the hydrochloric acid gone and replaced with vodka?!?!",
"Jun 22 - That son of a bitch swapped the natural gas and hydrogen tanks. I don't think he realizes how dangerous that could have been.",
"Jun 25 - Despite his clear genius, when asked on where he completed his education Kevin merely slapped me on the ass and told me to be a good servant and get him a coffee. He then proceeded to follow me around for the rest of the day making 'wide-load' truck-beeping sounds every time I moved.",
"Jul 1 - No matter how much evidence we provide, Kevin is unwilling to accept that the universe contains more than one odor. He insists it is all simply varition of the same scent. To prove it, he keeps randomly farting at our stations. I really hate this idiot. I honestly want him dead.",
"Jul 8 - Once again, every last sample in the lab gene storage has been removed and in their place are test tubes with googly-eyes glued to them.",
"June 9 - Kevin has broken into Dr. Lesley's computer. Kevin found out many people keep notes of him. Kevin is popular. This pleases Kevin.",
"Jul 7 - Twice this week the backup generator fuel was siphoned and completely replaced with Essentia Obscura, causing station-wide hallucinations. Where this fluid was even *obtained* is a question in and of itself.",
"Jul 17 - Ten days of glorious prank-free nonsense...and then I open up my Plasmic Fluid sample fridge and inside...no samples. There is a note, however, that thanks me for donating to the Juice Salvation Society.",
"Jul 18 - Woke up to my eyelids glued together. Thanks, Kevin.",
"Jul 21 - I cannot even begin to imagine how long it took Kevin to construct this statue of Kluex composed entirely of severed Poptop penises. If it weren't so horrific and apalling, I might actually be impressed. I'm less than pleased that he chose to do it on the long weekend, as it has been festering in the lobby for four days.",
"Jul 25 - Some one drown him! Please! I can't fathom how he considers it humorous but once again he has traded my prosthetic leg to a Gnome in exchange for a Gnome-sized jar of peanut butter. I'm not sure how he even *does* it. It's biometrically locked to my torso!",
"Aug 4 - Someone put ixo eggs in the air system. There are now about 900 ixolings rampaging in the kitchen. To 'calm them down' Kevin then added four pounds of Rage Powder. Four. Pounds. Where did he get that much of a class-A narcotic?!?!",
"Aug 8 - Another 'fat guy' joke from Kevin. He's recorded sounds of a tuba playing. Whenever I move, he presses play. This has been ongoing since Jul 16th, and I can't take it anymore.",
"Aug 12 - I really can't figure out how it is comical to replace someone's hair products with watered down sulphuric acid. My skin may be immune, but now I'm bald and look like the ass of a newborn.",
"Aug 22 - I think he's finally toned it down...Nothing since the 12th.",
"Aug 23 - Damnit. I spoke too soon. He apparently replaced all of the ostrich eggs in the enclosure with raptor eggs. They hatched, and ate the babies. When we got angry, he explained 'the eggs were lonely. I gave them friends.'",
"Aug 26 - Kevin won't let anyone near the raptors. He has dressed them all in tiny little ballerina tutus and refers to them as his 'students'.",
"Oct 12 - I'm impressed. In a short period of time, Kevin has trained the raptors to perform a simple ballet routine. Unfortunately, he calls it 'dance of the death claws', and had them perform it...in the now-repopulated ostrich enclosure.",
"Oct 13 - We've decided to dismantle the ostrich enclosure. We've invited some bee-science folk to come and fill the space. It made sense, on account of the *thousands of bees* he put in my office in June still roaming around.",
"Oct 15 - I attempted to prank Kevin. I apparently suck. Not only did it fail, he found it, dismantled it and placed it in my room. I am now the proud owner of a giant bucket of Poptop feces spilled on my floor.",
"Oct 20 - I cannot believe that just happened. Kevin weaponized a shark by using a capture ball on a timer attached to a complicated mechanism. I was eating lunch, and a *great white shark* appears directly above my table, eats my lunch, and then enters a portal on the table and dissapears. I really hate Kevin.",
"Oct 25 - Bandits attacked. Kevin used weaponized shark to kill them. Feeling less hateful.",
"Oct 26 - Kevin has used self-same weaponized shark device to instead create Bunny-things that won't stop making adorable sounds. We can't hurt them, because they just burrow into pocket dimensions or something...and then pop back out and annoy. This is not going to be fun.",
"Oct 27 - The Bunny-thing in my office is especially annoying. I think Kevin has genetically modified them, as mine cannot stop swearing. It literally does nothing but call me a litany of racist remarks, gives me the finger, and pops back into its...hole thing.",
"Oct 29 - Three days is enough. I left my office, and had the life support system withdraw all air from the unit. It took six minutes and fifty-three seconds but the bunny-thing died in panic. I am pleased.",
"Oct 31 - Whatever 'Halloween' was on Earth, I am more than certain it does not involve repeated attacks with a limp zucchini while shouting 'Excelsior!'. Kevin, however, disagrees with this and insists his knowledge of Earth ways is unmatched. Our human members are not incredibly pleased about this since Kevin has never even *been* to Earth.",
"Dec 25 - Well, he waited a while...probably because he was training the raptors again. They have now mastered the art of targeted defecation, and are utilizing this new skill as much as possible. To ensure 'maximum dance power' Kevin has set them to roam free in the nearby woods. They like to aim their shots through the windows when we open them.",
"Jan 3 - I've been getting reports of missing lab equipment and consumables, mostly CO2 canisters. I've decided to increase storage security.",
"Jan 5 - An explosion on the lower levels led to us finding Kevin launching wooden logs at a steel blade from what appears to be a CO2 cannon, constructed from fridge spare parts and duct tape. Later I also found out he was building an altar in my personal storage room decorated with photographs of my Uncle Steve. I have no idea how he got the pictures. Several piles of shaved wood sat in one corner, and a huge statue of my Uncle riding an angry Bullfrog made from split logs, decorated the other.",
"Jan 9 - Kevin was caught stealing large amounts of concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid and toluene. After an inspection of his room, a large box of nails was found, with the words 'Death to Equestria' scribbled on the side with crayons.",
"Jan 15 - Kevin has declared this week 'Vuvuzela Appreciation Week' in honor of a now nearly extinct Earth...instrument...if you can call it that. Within about 11 seconds, we wanted to murder him. We are now on hour seven. I have purchased a new rifle from the Ansible network.",
"Jan 24 - We received a shipment of about 400 000 of these vuvuzelas from the Ansible network. We also received a 15% discount card off our next big-scale purchase. Kevin was later found fuelling a bonfire with them and grilling mice over it.",
"Jan 30 - Kevin made a shrine for a bigger more primitive apex-like animal the humans had on earth, called 'haramber' or something. He kept making off with several of the stocked bananas. This only means we need to change the password on the food storage...again.",
"Feb 2 - Someone switched all of the Smarties with Skittles.",
"Feb 8 - After Kevin somehow got his hands on an ancient audiotrack of the old Earth music known as 'Darude; sandstorm', we weren't bothered at first. When he wouldn't let that damn song get a rest for several hours, even at night, we had to do something. We scheduled a trip to the most nearby desert biome with dangerous sandstorms tomorrow. Lets see if Kevin ever plays that Gods-forsaken song again after being sandblasted for an hour or two. We'll say it's a picnic.",
"Feb 9 - Yep. He kept playing the song. Louder. He then composed a version completely in reverse, played only with vomit sounds and a strange repeated word: 'Yolo'.",
"Feb 10 - I found a deep-fried mooshi scrotum on my desk today along with a side of ice cream and a Happy Birthday card. My birthday was nine months ago. He is also aware that I have an allergic reaction to Mooshi.",
"Feb 15 - We had to make clear to Kevin that 'surprise-feeding' us Glitch food, doesn't make us do 'the robot' any faster but instead gives us horrible indigestion and potentially lethal food poisoning. He insists that our version of science is akin to (and I quote) 'making love to a dead sea lion in the air while on fire'. I am now attempting to picture exactly what this act would look like.",
"Feb 18 - Norbert finally snapped. He pushed Kevin off the roof after luring him upstairs for 'ninja practice', a thing which no Kevin can resist. We had assumed at long last that we had freed ourselves from his tyrannical pranking. We were sorely mistaken. It turns out he has gene-linked his mind to this facility. Any attempt at murder results in a clone being immediately spawned using his most recent brainscan. He claims 'the station made him do it'. He also apparently 'invented the question mark'.",
"Feb 21 - Kevin kept persistently saying that 'the bird is the word' today. This made the meeting of the engineering staff awkward, seeing as he just burst in. And Axiena, the fuel-expert of us, who is an Avian was there. Now, being a 'bird' wouldn't be so bad to ignore kevin's 'quirks' but she's also a mute. Being reminded that she couldn't 'be the word' at all (having no vocal capability since birth) was rather rude. Preparing a cake congratulating her on her muteness was worse.",
"Feb 24 - Kevin came back from a research expedition. He brought somebody named 'Greg' with him. Please kill me.",
"Feb 25 - Kevin has been missing for several days. Nobody knows where he is. Also, somebody has been eating my cheesecake. I'll ask the cooks to bring it to my office.",
"Feb 27 - I'm sure somebody is breaking into my personal office to do nothing else but eat my cheesecake. Sounds like something Kevin would do, but he's nowhere to be seen.",
"Mar 1 - After routine inspection everything has been accounted for, except the prototype phase shift module Dr. Nilson has been working on. I have a very bad feeling about this.",
"Mar 2 - I found a note on my desk. 'You talk about cheesecake while you sleep. You also snore. Love, Kevin.'. I think I need to undergo psychiatric reevaluation.",
"Mar 4 - Kevin refused to work with any of the Glitch this week. Kept yelling that he couldn't bare the thought of thinking with those 'console peasants'. Which was odd, as the Glitch in that group aren't even near any console-panels.",
"Mar 8 - Kevin assaulted several crewmembers by throwing a capture capsule in their face after yelling at the top of his lungs - and I quote - 'Our eyes have met, we must battle!'. We still have no idea when, or how he managed to catch an adult Fleshreaper.",
"Mar 12 - He won't stop saying 'Eureka! I've done it!' and is running around like a maniac.",
"Mar 20 - He is still doing the Eureka thing.",
"Mar 28 - Well, he's finally showed us what his Eureka moment is. Apparently, he has single-handedly discovered how to make hamsters able to self-replicate instantly via application of sunlight. Why he thinks this is a pleasing result, that's another story entirely. He set them loose from his rather cramped lab into the goddamned *greenhouse*!",
"Mar 29 - He shared the reason of why he made this hamster fiasco happen; It was purely so that he could make a star system completely composed of hamsters. A ham-star, he said.",
"April 1 - Nothing to report.",
"April 2 - Kevin got air of our fossil restoration project, and wanted to join in. We gave him a Trilobite to clean off, and he did a good job at it (surprisingly). Unfortunately, we made the mistake of letting him choose the next fossil he wanted to prepare for showcasing on the exposition on the lower decks. We had to pry private Holix's grandmother - who came to visit - out of Kevin's hands.",
"April 9 - Kevin was urinating on one of the visiting Kirhos delegates, and got mad when we attempted to stop him. He claims that the man was stung by invisible jellyfish and he was merely attempting to help him ease his pain.",
"April 12 - I found Kevin in the break room today, rolling around on stolen cheese. We made eye contact. He seemed ashamed. He then moved over, and motioned that I should join him and explained by merely stating 'it's Tuesday'.",
"April 13 - Dereck was excited that Kevin had made him lunch today. When I explained the stolen cheese...he seemed somewhat less excited about his 'delicious cheese sandwich'",
"April 15 - Today it was like Kevin only just ever discovered what water did with paper. And he wouldn't shut up about how wonderfully soggy it felt.",
"April 18 - Kevin has wandered around for three days, screaming at the top of his lungs. When asked to stop, he tells us that 'my caps lock key is broken' and then gives us the finger.",
"April 19 - Today Kevin celebrated nudity day. This makes the total of 'times we didn't want to see Kevin nude' to 322.",
"April 25 - The medical bay was full of honey bees today. Kevin said he could help, and provided a briefcase. It held a rather large amount of yet more agitated bees.",
"April 26 - He now calls himself Dr.Bees. Non-stop. As if that wasn't annoying, he just burst into my office and said 'What's this? an office woefully unpopulated by bees? This briefcase full of BEES should take care of that!' and poured them into my office.",
"April 30 - Kevin came to the kitchen with a meal of cooked human hands, and fried faces today. Despite the morbid thoughts we had, and the salivating Floran crewmembers, we had to ask where he gotten these horrid recipes. He merely said he had an Alpaca friend somewhere, who was a hat enthusiast by the name of Carl.",
"May 2 - Our weapons research team had to ban Kevin from their wing, after he managed to destroy a data bank with a modified electric toothbrush.",
"May 15 - He's stopped being a douche for a bit now. I'm actually a little concerned. Ever since his friend MacReady left for the Wastes he's been acting a little odd...",
"May 20 - Well, seems he is back to normal. I awoke today with Kevin sitting on the edge of my bed, petting my feet and talking to them as if they were puppies. When I woke up, he told me I wasn't invited and I should leave , but leave the feet.",
"May 28 - Every single piece of art in the station has been replaced with a picture of Kevin and the words 'Lip Gloss' in bold underneath. No one has any clue what the hell this is about.",
"May 30 - Every single object in the station, floors included, is coated in lip gloss. I have no idea how this was accomplished. We were only gone 8 hours! Cleaning it is next to impossible. What an asshole.",
"Aug 31 - Nothing from Kevin for a whole month. Then, suddenly we all get thrown out of the outpost by some strange force. Apparently Kevin found a way to alter space-time by dropping liquids on painted dirt.",
"Sep 1 - Kevin invited a friend over with a particularly limited set of vocabulary. Since this time, 6 staff members can do nothing but speak the exact same dialect.",
"Sep 2 - Greg. Gregga greg?",
"Sep 5 - Kevin had baked cookies today and was handing them out. We didn't pay much attention to it at the time, although we should have. He came from the genetics lab with those. It wasn't clear to us until the cookies showed sentience by pleading not to eat them, and talking about their cardboard-related ideas for several minutes. We incinerated most of them, though one of them is kept around, for research purposes.",
"Sep 7 - We were awakened by terrible screams today. When we investigated, we found Kevin in a state of utter horror. When pressed for further information he merely gestured vaguely towards the kitchen. Inside the kitchen we found an open can. Inside the can we found a smaller version of Kevin, gesturing to a micro-sized version of the kitchen, inside of which was a tiny can, containing another tinier Kevin...and so on. We have no idea how this was done.",
"Sep 9 - The entire food supply has been replaced with odd, lumpy, red waffles that have an unusually meat-like aroma and a bizarre reddish-brown color with flecks of black not unlike rotting meat. I don't think I want to know. Kevin insists they are cherry flavor.",
"Sep 12 - Kevin was chasing scientists around with an agitated Lilodon today, humming a tune with increasing intensity. Often suggesting we should get a bigger boat. In related news, our boats are all missing.",
"Sep 13 - A loud buzzing sound is driving us all crazy. It's coming from Kevin's room. I am positive he's doing the bee thing again.",
"Sep 14 - The bee sound has stopped, and a rather large shipment of milk was delivered today. Exactly 2972 cartons, to be exact. I have no idea why.",
"Sep 19 - The cartons of milk have been relabelled 'Sour Milk and Bees'. Every food item in everyones private stores has been swapped with this. Our food, on the other hand, has been elaborately stitched into dresses.",
"Sep 8 - Kevin figured out time travel. Screw you guys!",
"Sep 9 - Today there were several rib-shattering injuries reported to staff. Upon further investigation I discovered that Vinalisj had a sign taped to his back. It read 'FREE RIDES $0.25'. People decided to go along with Kevin's pranks for a day and it appears that there have been multiple people jumping on the director's tail and promptly being flung into the nearest wall or desk.",
"Sep 10 - The directors' office door has been crudely painted like a skull-mounted stone crypt door, and his nameplate replaced with a poster saying 'This is the Vinal boss'. The only way in appears to be by opening Steve's storage locker and obtaining a key that weighs approximately 4 tons. Upon touching the key a very loud voice informs you that you have obtained the boss key, and plays a catchy 4-note tune. Any attempt to move is impossible unless you remove the key from the storage. Nobody is strong enough to do so.",
"Oct 2 - Xiticix, our security officer, has been in a huff all day. Kevin has been randomly jumping out from behind various office furniture and spraying him with bug spray. Upon being asked to stop, Kevin merely answers with KILLS BUGS DEAD and hides behind the planter in the lobby where we can plainly see him.",
"Oct 4 - The assault on Xiticix continues. Kevin has stolen every single piece of his clothing, and replaced them with numerous decorative cod-pieces. Xiticix is annoyed for several reasons. Firstly, his species does not possess mammalian genitals to facilitate such fashion accessories, and two, Kevin is also an insect and *knows* this is the case. When pressed, Kevin insists that wearing the cod-pieces will help him *grow* them.",
"Oct 9 - Interestingly, Kevin was not lying. Xiticix has grown a mammalian set of genitals. He is dismayed by this fact. Kevin insists he will be 'happier this way because now he can fly if it spins fast enough'",
"Oct 10 - Vinalisj has seen the situation with Xiticix and is now screaming constantly. I didn't know that a creature as large as him could make such a high-pitched, piercing shriek.",
"Oct 12 - While the cause is not clear, somehow Kevin has managed to convert every living thing in the outpost, myself included, into a moldable lump of putty. It is frustratingly difficult to write this log.",
"Oct 14 - 'Someone' placed a pleasure doll dressed as my mother in the staff room. While this was initially humorous, samples have shown that the doll contains traces of my familial DNA. Any attempt to touch or relocate the doll results in it speaking directly to the offender in my mother's voice and seductively asking them to make her a sandwich using rather graphic terminology.",
"Oct 16 - Steve killed himself. His suicide note simply read 'I hate you, Kevin'. Steve was especially vexed when he resurrected in Kevin's 'replication' terminal. Apparently, Kevin has gene-linked more than himself. How is he getting our samples!?!?! Why can none of us *escape his damnable pranks*?!?!?",
"Oct 31-1 - Kevin has claimed to have planned out a 'Halloween' party for later in the day. I am loathe to see what sort of shenanigans he has planned this year, as last year was far from pleasant. He's had various party supplies brought into the lab (where does he even get these things in such quantities?) and several ^red;tons^white; worth of pumpkins. He's barricaded me out of my office, claiming to be the 'Pumpkin King'.",
"Oct 31-2 - Kevin has taken the liberty of applying what I am hoping is fake blood to the walls of the lab. If it's real blood, that brings up the question of not only how he obtained such large quantities, but also from where. I'm thinking I should take an impromptu vacation just to avoid Kevin's schemes.",
"Oct 31-3 - I must admit, Kevin has a rather detailed zombie costume. Despite what it is depicting being rather graphic, the attention to detail is absolutely flawless. If he weren't so insufferable, I would actually give him the compliment in person.",
"Oct 31-4 - I take back any compliments I've given Kevin. That was not him in a zombie costume but a ^red;real^white; zombie. About ten scientists have been bitten and subsequently converted into undead monstrosities. I'm going to kill Kevin. Right after I kill these zombies. Now where did I leave my revolver?",

^#EDB347;Aug 26^#FFFFFF; - Kevin won't let anyone near the raptors. He has dressed them all in tiny little ballerina tutus and refers to them as his 'students'.",

"^#EDB347;Oct 12^#FFFFFF; - I'm impressed. In a short period of time, Kevin has trained the raptors to perform a simple ballet routine. Unfortunately, he calls it 'dance of the death claws', and had them perform it...in the now-repopulated ostrich enclosure.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 13^#FFFFFF; - We've decided to dismantle the ostrich enclosure. We've invited some bee-science folk to come and fill the space. It made sense, on account of the *thousands of bees* he put in my office in June still roaming around.\n

^#EDB347;Oct 25^#FFFFFF; - Bandits attacked. Kevin used weaponized shark to kill them. Feeling less hateful.\n

^#EDB347;Oct 27^#FFFFFF; - The Bunny-thing in my office is especially annoying. I think Kevin has genetically modified them, as mine cannot stop swearing. It literally does nothing but call me a litany of racist remarks, gives me the finger, and pops back into its...hole thing.\n

^#EDB347;Oct 31^#FFFFFF; - Whatever 'Halloween' was on Earth, I am more than certain it does not involve repeated attacks with a limp zucchini while shouting 'Excelsior!'. Kevin, however, disagrees with this and insists his knowledge of Earth ways is unmatched. Our human members are not incredibly pleased about this since Kevin has never even *been* to Earth.",

"^#EDB347;Dec 25^#FFFFFF; - Well, he waited a while...probably because he was training the raptors again. They have now mastered the art of targeted defecation, and are utilizing this new skill as much as possible. To ensure 'maximum dance power' Kevin has set them to roam free in the nearby woods. They like to aim their shots through the windows when we open them.",


"^#EDB347;Jan 3^#FFFFFF; - I've been getting reports of missing lab equipment and consumables, mostly CO2 canisters. I've decided to increase storage security.\n
^#EDB347;Jan 5^#FFFFFF; - An explosion on the lower levels led to us finding Kevin launching wooden logs at a steel blade from what appears to be a CO2 cannon, constructed from fridge spare parts and duct tape. Later I also found out he was building an altar in my personal storage room decorated with photographs of my Uncle Steve. I have no idea how he got the pictures. Several piles of shaved wood sat in one corner, and a huge statue of my Uncle riding an angry Bullfrog made from split logs, decorated the other.\n
^#EDB347;Jan 9^#FFFFFF; - Kevin was caught stealing large amounts of concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid and toluene. After an inspection of his room, a large box of nails was found, with the words 'Death to Equestria' scribbled on the side with crayons.\n
^#EDB347;Jan 15^#FFFFFF; - Kevin has declared this week 'Vuvuzela Appreciation Week' in honor of a now nearly extinct Earth...instrument...if you can call it that. Within about 11 seconds, we wanted to murder him. We are now on hour seven. I have purchased a new rifle from the Ansible network.\n
^#EDB347;Jan 24^#FFFFFF; - We received a shipment of about 400 000 of these vuvuzelas from the Ansible network. We also received a 15% discount card off our next big-scale purchase. Kevin was later found fuelling a bonfire with them and grilling mice over it.\n
^#EDB347;Jan 30^#FFFFFF; - Kevin made a shrine for a bigger more primitive apex-like animal the humans had on earth, called 'haramber' or something. He kept making off with several of the stocked bananas. This only means we need to change the password on the food storage...again.",

"^#EDB347;Feb 2^#FFFFFF; - Someone switched all of the Smarties with Skittles.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 8^#FFFFFF; - After Kevin somehow got his hands on an ancient audiotrack of the old Earth music known as 'Darude; sandstorm', we weren't bothered at first. When he wouldn't let that damn song get a rest for several hours, even at night, we had to do something. We scheduled a trip to the most nearby desert biome with dangerous sandstorms tomorrow. Lets see if Kevin ever plays that Gods-forsaken song again after being sandblasted for an hour or two. We'll say it's a picnic.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 9^#FFFFFF; - Yep. He kept playing the song. Louder. He then composed a version completely in reverse, played only with vomit sounds and a strange repeated word: 'Yolo'.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 10^#FFFFFF; - I found a deep-fried mooshi scrotum on my desk today along with a side of ice cream and a Happy Birthday card. My birthday was nine months ago. He is also aware that I have an allergic reaction to Mooshi.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 15^#FFFFFF; - We had to make clear to Kevin that 'surprise-feeding' us Glitch food, doesn't make us do 'the robot' any faster but instead gives us horrible indigestion and potentially lethal food poisoning. He insists that our version of science is akin to (and I quote) 'making love to a dead sea lion in the air while on fire'. I am now attempting to picture exactly what this act would look like.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 18^#FFFFFF; - Norbert finally snapped. He pushed Kevin off the roof after luring him upstairs for 'ninja practice', a thing which no Kevin can resist. We had assumed at long last that we had freed ourselves from his tyrannical pranking. We were sorely mistaken. It turns out he has gene-linked his mind to this facility. Any attempt at murder results in a clone being immediately spawned using his most recent brainscan. He claims 'the station made him do it'. He also apparently 'invented the question mark'.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 21^#FFFFFF; - Kevin kept persistently saying that 'the bird is the word' today. This made the meeting of the engineering staff awkward, seeing as he just burst in. And Axiena, the fuel-expert of us, who is an Avian was there. Now, being a 'bird' wouldn't be so bad to ignore kevin's 'quirks' but she's also a mute. Being reminded that she couldn't 'be the word' at all (having no vocal capability since birth) was rather rude. Preparing a cake congratulating her on her muteness was worse.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 24^#FFFFFF; - Kevin came back from a research expedition. He brought somebody named 'Greg' with him. Please kill me.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 25^#FFFFFF; - Kevin has been missing for several days. Nobody knows where he is. Also, somebody has been eating my cheesecake. I'll ask the cooks to bring it to my office.\n
^#EDB347;Feb 27^#FFFFFF; - I'm sure somebody is breaking into my personal office to do nothing else but eat my cheesecake. Sounds like something Kevin would do, but he's nowhere to be seen.",


"^#EDB347;Mar 1^#FFFFFF; - After routine inspection everything has been accounted for, except the prototype phase shift module Dr. Nilson has been working on. I have a very bad feeling about this.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 2^#FFFFFF; - I found a note on my desk. 'You talk about cheesecake while you sleep. You also snore. Love, Kevin.'. I think I need to undergo psychiatric reevaluation.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 4^#FFFFFF; - Kevin refused to work with any of the Glitch this week. Kept yelling that he couldn't bare the thought of thinking with those 'console peasants'. Which was odd, as the Glitch in that group aren't even near any console-panels.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 8^#FFFFFF; - Kevin assaulted several crewmembers by throwing a capture capsule in their face after yelling at the top of his lungs - and I quote - 'Our eyes have met, we must battle!'. We still have no idea when, or how he managed to catch an adult Fleshreaper.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 12^#FFFFFF; - He won't stop saying 'Eureka! I've done it!' and is running around like a maniac.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 20^#FFFFFF; - He is still doing the Eureka thing.\n
^#EDB347;Mar 28^#FFFFFF; - Well, he's finally showed us what his Eureka moment is. Apparently, he has single-handedly discovered how to make hamsters able to self-replicate instantly via application of sunlight. Why he thinks this is a pleasing result, that's another story entirely. He set them loose from his rather cramped lab into the goddamned *greenhouse*!\n
^#EDB347;Mar 29^#FFFFFF; - He shared the reason of why he made this hamster fiasco happen; It was purely so that he could make a star system completely composed of hamsters. A ham-star, he said.",

"^#EDB347;April 1^#FFFFFF; - Nothing to report.\n
^#EDB347;April 2^#FFFFFF; - Kevin got air of our fossil restoration project, and wanted to join in. We gave him a Trilobite to clean off, and he did a good job at it (surprisingly). Unfortunately, we made the mistake of letting him choose the next fossil he wanted to prepare for showcasing on the exposition on the lower decks. We had to pry private Holix's grandmother - who came to visit - out of Kevin's hands.\n
^#EDB347;April 9^#FFFFFF; - Kevin was urinating on one of the visiting Kirhos delegates, and got mad when we attmpted to stop him. He claims that the man was stung by invisible jellyfish and he was merely attempting to help him ease his pain.\n
^#EDB347;April 12^#FFFFFF; - I found Kevin in the break room today, rolling around on stolen cheese. We made eye contact. He seemed ashamed. He then moved over, and motioned that I should join him and explained by merely stating 'it's Tuesday'.\n
^#EDB347;April 13^#FFFFFF; - Dereck was excited that Kevin had made him lunch today. When I explained the stolen cheese...he seemed somewhat less excited about his 'delicious cheese sandwich'\n
^#EDB347;April 15^#FFFFFF; - Today it was like Kevin only just ever discovered what water did with paper. And he wouldn't shut up about how wonderfully soggy it felt.\n
^#EDB347;April 18^#FFFFFF; - Kevin has wandered around for three days, screaming at the top of his lungs. When asked to stop, he tells us that 'my caps lock key is broken' and then gives us the finger.\n
^#EDB347;April 19^#FFFFFF; - Today Kevin celebrated nudity day. This makes the total of 'times we didn't want to see Kevin nude' to 322.\n
^#EDB347;April 25^#FFFFFF; - The medical bay was full of honey bees today. Kevin said he could help, and provided a briefcase. It held a rather large amount of yet more agitated bees.\n
^#EDB347;April 26^#FFFFFF; - He now calls himself Dr.Bees. Non-stop. As if that wasn't annoying, he just burst into my office and said 'What's this? an office woefully unpopulated by bees? This briefcase full of BEES should take care of that!' and poured them into my office.\n
^#EDB347;April 30^#FFFFFF; - Kevin came to the kitchen with a meal of cooked human hands, and fried faces today. Despite the morbid thoughts we had, and the salivating Floran crewmembers, we had to ask where he gotten these horrid recipes. He merely said he had an Alpaca friend somewhere, who was a hat enthusiast by the name of Carl.",

"^#EDB347;May 2^#FFFFFF; - Our weapons research team had to ban Kevin from their wing, after he managed to destroy a data bank with a modified electric toothbrush.\n
^#EDB347;May 15^#FFFFFF; - He's stopped being a douche for a bit now. I'm actually a little concerned. Ever since his friend MacReady left for the Wastes he's been acting a little odd...\n
^#EDB347;May 20^#FFFFFF; - Well, seems he is back to normal. I awoke today with Kevin sitting on the edge of my bed, petting my feet and talking to them as if they were puppies. When I woke up, he told me I wasn't invited and I should leave , but leave the feet.\n
^#EDB347;May 28^#FFFFFF; - Every single piece of art in the station has been replaced with a picture of Kevin and the words 'Lip Gloss' in bold underneath. No one has any clue what the hell this is about.\n
^#EDB347;May 30^#FFFFFF; - Every single object in the station, floors included, is coated in lip gloss. I have no idea how this was accomplished. We were only gone 8 hours! Cleaning it is next to impossible. What an asshole.",

"^#EDB347;Aug 31^#FFFFFF; - Nothing from Kevin for a whole month. Then, suddenly we all get thrown out of the outpost by some strange force. Apparently Kevin found a way to alter space-time by dropping liquids on painted dirt.",

"^#EDB347;Sep 1^#FFFFFF; - Kevin invited a friend over with a particularly limited set of vocabulary. Since this time, 6 staff members can do nothing but speak the exact same dialect.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 2^#FFFFFF; - Greg. Gregga greg?\n
^#EDB347;Sep 5^#FFFFFF; - Kevin had baked cookies today and was handing them out. We didn't pay much attention to it at the time, although we should have. He came from the genetics lab with those. It wasn't clear to us until the cookies showed sentience by pleading not to eat them, and talking about their cardboard-related ideas for several minutes. We incinerated most of them, though one of them is kept around, for research purposes.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 7^#FFFFFF; - We were awakened by terrible screams today. When we investigated, we found Kevin in a state of utter horror. When pressed for further information he merely gestured vaguely towards the kitchen. Inside the kitchen we found an open can. Inside the can we found a smaller version of Kevin, gesturing to a micro-sized version of the kitchen, inside of which was a tiny can, containing another tinier Kevin...and so on. We have no idea how this was done.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 9^#FFFFFF; - The entire food supply has been replaced with odd, lumpy, red waffles that have an unusually meat-like aroma and a bizarre reddish-brown color with flecks of black not unlike rotting meat. I don't think I want to know. Kevin insists they are cherry flavor.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 12^#FFFFFF; - Kevin was chasing scientists around with an agitated Lilodon today, humming a tune with increasing intensity. Often suggesting we should get a bigger boat. In related news, our boats are all missing.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 13^#FFFFFF; - A loud buzzing sound is driving us all crazy. It's coming from Kevin's room. I am positive he's doing the bee thing again.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 14^#FFFFFF; - The bee sound has stopped, and a rather large shipment of milk was delivered today. Exactly 2972 cartons, to be exact. I have no idea why.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 19^#FFFFFF; - The cartons of milk have been relabelled 'Sour Milk and Bees'. Every food item in everyones private stores has been swapped with this. Our food, on the other hand, has been elaborately stitched into dresses.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 8^#FFFFFF; - Kevin figured out time travel. Screw you guys!\n
^#EDB347;Sep 9^#FFFFFF; - Today there were several rib-shattering injuries reported to staff. Upon further investigation I discovered that Vinalisj had a sign taped to his back. It read 'FREE RIDES $0.25'. People decided to go along with Kevin's pranks for a day and it appears that there have been multiple people jumping on the director's tail and promptly being flung into the nearest wall or desk.\n
^#EDB347;Sep 10^#FFFFFF; - The directors' office door has been crudely painted like a skull-mounted stone crypt door, and his nameplate replaced with a poster saying 'This is the Vinal boss'. The only way in appears to be by opening Steve's storage locker and obtaining a key that weighs approximately 4 tons. Upon touching the key a very loud voice informs you that you have obtained the boss key, and plays a catchy 4-note tune. Any attempt to move is impossible unless you remove the key from the storage. Nobody is strong enough to do so.",

"^#EDB347;Oct 2^#FFFFFF; - Xiticix, our security officer, has been in a huff all day. Kevin has been randomly jumping out from behind various office furniture and spraying him with bug spray. Upon being asked to stop, Kevin merely answers with KILLS BUGS DEAD and hides behind the planter in the lobby where we can plainly see him.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 4^#FFFFFF; - The assault on Xiticix continues. Kevin has stolen every single piece of his clothing, and replaced them with numerous decorative cod-pieces. Xiticix is annoyed for several reasons. Firstly, his species does not possess mammalian genitals to facilitate such fashion accessories, and two, Kevin is also an insect and *knows* this is the case. When pressed, Kevin insists that wearing the cod-pieces will help him *grow* them.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 9^#FFFFFF; - Interestingly, Kevin was not lying. Xiticix has grown a mammalian set of genitals. He is dismayed by this fact. Kevin insists he will be 'happier this way because now he can fly if it spins fast enough'\n
^#EDB347;Oct 10^#FFFFFF; - Vinalisj has seen the situation with Xiticix and is now screaming constantly. I didn't know that a creature as large as him could make such a high-pitched, piercing shriek.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 12^#FFFFFF; - While the cause is not clear, somehow Kevin has managed to convert every living thing in the outpost, myself included, into a moldable lump of putty. It is frustratingly difficult to write this log.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 14^#FFFFFF; - 'Someone' placed a pleasure doll dressed as my mother in the staff room. While this was initially humorous, samples have shown that the doll contains traces of my familial DNA. Any attempt to touch or relocate the doll results in it speaking directly to the offender in my mother's voice and seductively asking them to make her a sandwich using rather graphic terminology.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 16^#FFFFFF; - Steve killed himself. His suicide note simply read 'I hate you, Kevin'. Steve was especially vexed when he resurrected in Kevin's 'replication' terminal. Apparently, Kevin has gene-linked more than himself. How is he getting our samples!?!?! Why can none of us *escape his damnable pranks*?!?!?\n
^#EDB347;Oct 31-1^#FFFFFF; - Kevin has claimed to have planned out a 'Halloween' party for later in the day. I am loathe to see what sort of shenanigans he has planned this year, as last year was far from pleasant. He's had various party supplies brought into the lab (where does he even get these things in such quantities?) and several ^red;tons^white; worth of pumpkins. He's barricaded me out of my office, claiming to be the 'Pumpkin King'.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 31-2^#FFFFFF; - Kevin has taken the liberty of applying what I am hoping is fake blood to the walls of the lab. If it's real blood, that brings up the question of not only how he obtained such large quantities, but also from where. I'm thinking I should take an impromptu vacation just to avoid Kevin's schemes.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 31-3^#FFFFFF; - I must admit, Kevin has a rather detailed zombie costume. Despite what it is depicting being rather graphic, the attention to detail is absolutely flawless. If he weren't so insufferable, I would actually give him the compliment in person.\n
^#EDB347;Oct 31-4^#FFFFFF; - I take back any compliments I've given Kevin. That was not him in a zombie costume but a ^red;real^white; zombie. About ten scientists have been bitten and subsequently converted into undead monstrosities. I'm going to kill Kevin. Right after I kill these zombies. Now where did I leave my revolver?",

"^#EDB347;Nov 16^#FFFFFF; - Today we had a new visitor, and by \"new\" I mean \"we have never seen this species up until today\". He says his species is \"Spirit Guardian\", or just \"Spirit\" for short. He was quite popular with the bio-science team, given that his species has biological males and females, yet they do not have the organs necessary for procreation. He explained that they are instead created by a giant tree called the \"Spirit Tree\".\n\nThis information was very interesting to our team members, so they asked him to return to the outpost tomorrow for some testing. I bring this up in the infraction log because I couldn't help but to notice Kevin frequently walking in front of the doorway to our meeting room during our initial encounter with the Spirit. It was kind of giving me a bad vibe. I'll have to ask him what's on his mind.\n
^#EDB347;Nov 17^#FFFFFF; - Turns out that Kevin was simply interested in participating in the tests we had planned for today. We had planned to take a genetic sample, take measurements of his body proportions and mass, and get other various physiological attributes. The usual stuff.\n\nEverything went smoothly, and dare I say that Kevin was actually *pretty helpful* in getting this thing done. Not only that, but our visitor became quite comfortable with him. I was thinking on actually thanking him for his good work, but before I could, Kevin left the lab because he had to \"go to the bathroom\". Not that big a deal, we were in the conclusion process anyway, so we were able to finish the work without him. Turns out, Kevin was just waiting behind the doorway with an airhorn. When the Spirit left the room, Kevin blew the horn. The Spirit got scared so badly that when he kicked off of the wall to propel himself away, he ended up putting a good size dent into the sheet metal. I think the sound of him kicking the wall startled people more than the airhorn did, now that I consider it."
